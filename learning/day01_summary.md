Date: 2025-08-16
Script: step1_read_data.py

## What I Accomplished Today:
✅ Successfully read vulnerability data from CSV file
✅ Learned basic pandas operations (read_csv, head, shape, columns)
✅ Understood vulnerability data structure
✅ Created my first data analysis script

## Data Summary:
- Total vulnerabilities analyzed: 15
- Number of columns: 8
- Columns: Asset_Name, IP_Address, Vulnerability_Name, Severity, CVE_ID, Found_Date, Description, Status

## Key Learning:
- pandas.read_csv() is used to load CSV files
- .shape tells us rows and columns (rows, columns)
- .head() shows first few records
- .columns gives us column names
- .value_counts() counts occurrences of each value

## Tomorrow's Goals:
- Learn to filter data for specific criteria
- Find only "High" and "Critical" vulnerabilities
- Count vulnerabilities per asset

## Challenges Faced:
[Write any problems you encountered and how you solved them]

## Code Skills Gained:
- File reading with pandas
- Basic data exploration
- Error handling with try/except
- Function creation

# My Cybersecurity Data Engineering Learning Journey

🚀 **Learning Goal**: Master data engineering fundamentals through practical cybersecurity projects

**Current Status**: Day 2 - Security prioritization and filtering mastered!  
**Next Milestone**: Complete trend analysis and grouping (Day 5)
**Weekly Goal**: Build comprehensive vulnerability analysis toolkit

## 📊 Project Overview

Building a simple vulnerability data analysis tool to learn:
- Python data processing with pandas
- Basic data analysis and reporting
- Automated security insights generation
- Professional code documentation

## 🗓️ Learning Schedule

### Week 1: Data Reading & Basic Analysis
- **Day 1**: ✅ Read CSV files and explore data structure
- **Day 2**: ✅ Filter data by severity and create priority reports  
- **Day 3**: ⏳ Count and group vulnerabilities by patterns
- **Day 4**: ⏳ Find trends and time-based analysis
- **Day 5**: ⏳ Generate comprehensive summary reports

### Week 2: Advanced Analysis & Visualization
- Coming soon...

## 📈 Progress Tracking

**Scripts Created**: 2  
**Data Files Processed**: 15 vulnerability records  
**Reports Generated**: 3 automated CSV reports  
**Key Concepts Learned**: 8 (filtering, boolean indexing, prioritization)  
**GitHub Commits**: 2
**Professional Skills**: Security prioritization, risk assessment, automated reporting

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib
- **Tools**: VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Platform**: macOS (MacBook Air)

- Vulnerability details (CVE IDs, severity levels)
- Status tracking (open, patched)
- Discovery dates and descriptions

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [https://github.com/SugumarSrinivasan/cybersecurity-data-learning.git]
cd cybersecurity-data-learning
source venv/bin/activate

# Run Day 1 analysis
python3 scripts/step1_read_data.py

# Run Day 2 analysis
python scripts/step2_filter_data.py

# Check the generated reports
ls reports/
```
